## üìÑ Summary of Your Solution (under 150 words)

CodeGrade AI solves the problem of manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent code reviews for educators and developers. It works by using Large Language Models (like GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 1.5 Pro) to perform a secure, static analysis of the code. The tool evaluates code quality, documentation, and adherence to project requirements without ever running the code, ensuring safety. It provides a detailed, structured report with scores, a visual radar chart, and actionable feedback. The core technologies used are **Python**, **Streamlit**, and the **OpenAI & Google Gemini APIs**.

## üìñ About The Project

CodeGrade AI is a powerful tool that uses Large Language Models (like OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini) to provide structured and automated feedback on code submissions.

This tool is specifically designed for educators, teaching assistants, and developers who need to review code quickly and consistently. It analyzes code quality, documentation, and project requirements, **without ever running the code**, which ensures a safe and secure evaluation process.

*This project was created by **Team HackX** for the **NatWest Hack4Cause**.*

---

## üöÄ Key Features

* **ü§ñ Dual AI Engine Support**: Seamlessly switch between **OpenAI (GPT models)** and **Google Gemini**.
* **üìä Structured Evaluation**: Get detailed reports with scores (0-10) in three core areas:
    * **Code Quality**: Readability, structure, and best practices.
    * **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of the README file.
    * **Adherence to Requirements**: How well the code follows the project goals.
* **üìù Detailed Rubric**: Actionable insights on "What Went Well," "Areas for Improvement," and "Suggested Next Steps."
* **üé® Visual Reports**: Visualize scores on a beautiful **Radar Chart**.
* **‚¨áÔ∏è Downloadable Reports**: Export the entire evaluation as a **JSON file**.
* **üîí Secure by Design**: The app only performs **static analysis** and **never executes** the uploaded code.
* **üé® Modern UI**: A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
